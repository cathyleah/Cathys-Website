  <h3> About </h3>
    <p>After years studying as a Sommelier both in restaurants and running a winery, I began looking for a change of pace. I have always been fascinated by computers and thought it would be my career path had I not been in wine. Last month I started a Software Engineering course with Thinkful and am excited to see where it takes me!</p>

<p>When I'm not studying I enjoy tending to my dozens of houseplants, cooking and enjoying the outdoors. </p>

<p> If you are looking to hire a new developer, please reach out. I have just begun my journey but am determined and hardworking.</p>
